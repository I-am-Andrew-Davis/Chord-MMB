MBFR - MultiBlockFluxRegister
MBCS - MultiBlockCoordinateSystem
LGM  - LevelGridMetrics
- MBFR takes MBCS from fine and coarse levels.  Annoying to allocate this if
  the finer level does not exist.
- LevelGridMetrics should be renamed to AMRLevelGridMetrics.
- Multiblock operators should be removed from LevelGridMetrics since they are
  mostly single-level operators.
- Block domains are done in LGM.  This should be done elsewhere.  The whole
  concept of problem domain and block domain needs to be revisited.
- computeMetricTermProductAverage needs to move out of LGM.
- we should not need LGM in CNSPhysics.cpp
- Why on earth does LGM need a non-const MBCS factory in define()?
- LGM should use an RCP to MBCS instead of having a million instantations all
  over the place.
- MOLUtilities - most of these should be constant
- Box should be annotated to store the parent block.  It is too difficult,
  nevermind inefficient, to try to recover a disjoint box and use this to
  find the encompassing block.
