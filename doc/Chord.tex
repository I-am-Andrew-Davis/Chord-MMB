\subsection{Tagging Cells}

\path{TagLevel} is a class that holds methods for tagging cells on a level.
\path{TagMethod} is a abstract base class for these methods.
The \path{TagLevel} class is constructed for the \path{AMRLevelCNS} class by the \path{AMRLevelCNSFactory} object.
This class may itself use \path{TagLevelFactory} to construct the tag level.
This is a bit superfluous but allows for quite a bit of flexibility.
